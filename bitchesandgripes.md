Today 8/9/2023 8:21am.  Ukraine is holding steady.  Haven't talked or heard from Silus for 5 days I believe.  Brandy just once.  Hayden almost daily.  Makes my heart sing to even think of Hayden.  Usually
Kyah, I've sent several passages from Einstein on life and such.

My goal today.  Get one of my two cars running good enough to drive to Everett tomorrow.

Also, I have at least 5 classes in the queue to finish up.  First, using Microsoft's only fairly good product, Word, I need to document the classes.
Then, convert the documents (.docx) to markdown.  Edit the markdown.  Then use Pandoc to convert to an HTML file for publishing on the World Wide Web.

Plan to work on Briansblog.bauska.org.  Problems with the Cascade Style Sheet.  I believe. Need to setup test environment to narrow down the issues.

6/12/2024 12:04pm.  Rent at Fred Meyer $735.00.  Giving me about 100.00 to live on for the next 28+ days.  Under 4.00 a day. 
Working on DOM Tree - switch from Xmas to any other holiday.  
Working on SayHi as well.  More learning of progressive, responsive websites. Phone is like 80% of WWW now.
Silus Gaming World - SEO - switch up. Whatever that means.
My blog.  Add to do list for shopping (groceries).
